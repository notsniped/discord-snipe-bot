# Discord Snipe Bot
![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?color=%2336BCF7&lines=You+can+snipe+message+content;You+can+editsnipe+message+content)

This is a bot made with the same message content sniping API from isobot and Arch bot. The bot uses built-in Discord slash commands (`/`), so all commands start with the `/` prefix.

To run it, go into config.json in the project folder. Enter your bot token for the "token" value. You can get your Discord bot token from https://discord.com/developers.

In the code, replace 'EMPTY_USERNAME#0000' in the `owner` variable with your Discord username. (found within the User Configuration section)

# How to Use
### Installation
To install for windows, run win_cmd_install.bat.

If you are on a machine running GNU/Linux, run linux_installer.sh.

### Running
Run this code in command prompt/terminal:

```
$ cd path/to/folder/
$ python Main.py
```

When you run this, the client will ask you to input a **Discord bot token** and your **Discord username**. Simply paste them into the prompts during the setup process.

(you can get a bot token from making a new application at https://discord.com/developers)

# Features
• `/snipe` command to show the most recently deleted message in a channel.

• `/editsnipe` command to show the most recently edited message in a channel.
